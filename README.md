# Enhanced Demand Forecasting System For Food and Raw Materials Using Ensemble Learning

## Abstract:
Food wastage and raw materials deterioration are the most noteworthy predicaments faced by any food selling business. To avoid wastage, the restaurants should have prior knowledge of the amount of food required. Several solutions with the help of AI have been compounded to solve this problem of food wastage. Nevertheless, much of this research concentrates on the prediction of sales and its accuracy. It is important to note that sales prediction alone wonâ€™t be enough to decrease food wastage. Predicting the number of raw materials required also plays a crucial role in reducing food wastage. Therefore, in this paper, a demand forecasting system is proposed that predicts the number of customers, sales for particular dishes, and the amount of raw materials required. Stacking technique is used in the proposed model for making the predictions. This model has been evaluated with the help of MAE metric and it ranges from 0.4 to 0.7. The proposed system will help the restaurant cook dishes and buy raw materials with minimum wastage.

## Data Collection:
The dataset is collected from Siddhartha Restaurant, Hyderabad. The data has been collected from January 2018 to December 2019 with 730 records. The independent variables are year, month, date, day, weather conditions, public holidays, and festive season.

## Data Analysis:
The data is analyzed to apprehend the relationship between independent and dependent variables. Fig. 1 illustrates the percentage of customers visiting the restaurant on different days of the week. The weekends constitute 36% of the customers visiting the restaurant. It is noticed that the sales at the restaurant are highest during the weekends. Fig. 2 depicts the average sales
of each dish during the festive and non-festive seasons. It is observed that sales during the festive season are high compared to regular days. 
Fig. 3 shows the average number of customers visiting the
restaurant during different weather conditions. It is inferred that
the number of customers visiting during the rainy season is low
and high during cold climatic conditions.

As mentioned earlier, perishable goods have a short shelf
life, so they are bought daily. On the other hand, non-perishable
goods have a long shelf life and can be purchased in bulk. Fig. 4
shows the average amount of non-perishable goods required for
each month, and Fig.5 represents the average amount of
perishable goods per day in the month of January.
